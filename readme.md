This is an interactive demonstration of the CSS3 flexbox layout model. Change the properties of the container to see how it affects the layout of the children! You can also edit flex properties for individual children. Click a child to make it editable. There is an accompanying [blog post](http://blog.krawaller.se/posts/a-react-app-demonstrating-css3-flexbox/).

## To run the app
```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
Then browse to http://localhost:5000
